\begin{abstract}
    One fundamental characteristic of block ciphers
    is that a certain plaintext block is always mapped to the same ciphertext block.
    Thus,
    for chosen plaintext attacks,
    the adversary can detect when the same piece of information
    is being written twice to the disk.
    Our goal is to adapt a block cipher
    so that it is not vulnerable to this sort of attack.
